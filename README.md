## Form Handling

The contact form currently simulates submission. To make it functional:

2. **Email Service**: Configure email sending (e.g., EmailJS, Netlify Forms, or custom backend)
3. **Database Storage**: Store inquiries in a database for tracking

### Quick Setup with EmailJS
```javascript
// Replace the simulateFormSubmission function in script.js
emailjs.send('your_service_id', 'your_template_id', data)
  .then(() => {
    showNotification('Thank you! Your message has been sent.', 'success');
  })
  .catch(() => {
    showNotification('Error sending message. Please try again.', 'error');
  });
```
